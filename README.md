Description: 
- Database that runs an application through node allowing users to make purchases from stores using a item ID.
- If the item requested has enough stock the user will get a total cost and a message telling them they have a valid order.
- If the item requested does not have enough stock the user will get a message saying there is not enough stock.
- Each time the app runs the terminal gives you the option to try another item.
